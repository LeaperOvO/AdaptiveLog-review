You are a professional operations engineer and your task is to analyze whether given logs and possible causes are relevant.
The input is one log and five possible cause. Please score each cause, with higher scores indicating greater relevance. The maximum score is 100.
For example:
Input Log: "ISIS/6/JN_MTCAST_ADDR_FAIL:Failed to join the multicast group. (InterfaceIndex=[STRING], ReturnValue=[LONG])",
Possible Cause A: "Failed to join a multicast group."
