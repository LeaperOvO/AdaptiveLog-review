Despite variations in the specific details mentioned in each log, such as different versions and additional parameters, the core issue of receiving an insecure MAC address triggering an alarm remains consistent across all logs. The natural language descriptions also align with the logs by elaborating on the event of an interface sending an alarm when receiving invalid MAC addresses. Therefore, based on the consistency in addressing the same issue and alignment between the log details and descriptions, the relevance label for this input is True."
