  "Reason: The log message indicates that OSPF cannot exit the helper mode on a specific interface due to the absence of a restarting neighbor. This suggests a technical issue related to neighbor relationships in OSPF.\nConsidering the error-prone cases, we can see that the relevance score is high when the provided cause directly addresses the technical issue mentioned in the log message.\nPossible Cause A directly aligns with the situation described in the log message, indicating that no neighbor needing restart help was found on the interface, which correlates well with the details provided.\nPossible Cause B, C, D, and E do not directly address the specific technical issue related to the absence of a restarting neighbor in OSPF, making them less relevant.\n\nOutput: A: 100, B: 0, C: 0, D: 0, E: 0"

  "Reason: The log message indicates that the device session resources were resumed in the FORWARD module. The key information is about the device session resources being resumed.\nConsidering the provided possible causes:\n- Cause A talks about the reduction in the number of SAC forwarding flow tables on the device, which could potentially impact session resources. This cause seems relevant.\n- Cause B mentions a specific configuration command related to MPLS TE protect-switch, which does not directly relate to the device session resources being resumed. This cause is not directly relevant.\n- Cause C provides generic causes related to entry creation and configuration changes, which do not specifically address the device session resources being resumed. This cause is not directly relevant.\n- Cause D talks about a failure to find a neighbor record in the DNDB, which does not directly relate to the device session resources being resumed. This cause is not directly relevant.\n- Cause E mentions the replacement of an SSL certificate, which is not directly related to the device session resources being resumed. This cause is not directly relevant.\n\nOutput: A: 90, B: 10, C: 5, D: 0, E: 5"
